# Sentimental-Analysis-from-Flipkart-reviews-using-python
The analysis of the reviews and ratings user gives on Flipkart to make others aware of their experience and about the quality of the product and brand. So, by analyzing that data we can tell the users a lot about the products and also the ways to enhance the quality of the product. 

The libraries used are : 

Pandas: For importing the dataset.
Scikit-learn: For importing the model, accuracy module, and TfidfVectorizer.
Warning: To ignore all the warnings
Matplotlib: To plot the visualization. Also used Wordcloud for that.
Seaborn: For data visualization.
